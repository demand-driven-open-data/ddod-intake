Thank you for your interest in the Demand-Driven Open Data (DDOD) pilot. This pilot is currently on hold, but please use go ahead and use the knowledge base here (https://github.com/demand-driven-open-data/ddod-intake/issues) and in the wiki (http://ddod.healthdata.gov) to learn about existing use cases. Unfortunately we are not able to handle additional DDOD use cases at this time.
